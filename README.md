# web-scraping-regression
SDAIA Bootcamp project 2 - web scraping/linear regression.

This project aims to predict ticket prices for upcoming flights to help customers in selecting the optimum time for travel and the cheapest flight to the desired destination. A linear regression model will be applied to forecast the cheapest flight tickets to a specific destination based on data scraped from a variety of travel websites such as Momondo, Kayak, and Expedia .
